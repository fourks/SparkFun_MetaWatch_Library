  A no serial necessary (hopefully) MetaWatch example. Want
  to control your MetaWatch without ever opening up the Serial
  Monitor? Here's some skeleton code to get you started.
  
  Before you upload: there are a few variables that need setting:
  - metaWatchAddress: This should match the BT address of your 
  MetaWatch -- click button D on the watch, and the address
  is the xxxx-xxxx-xxxx formatted number at the bottom. Don't put
  dashes in the metaWatchAddress variable.
  - btBaudRate: Set this variable to the baud rate of your 
  BlueSMiRF (defaults to 115200, but 9600 works better).
  - year, month, date, day, hours, minutes, seconds: Pretty 
  obvious what these do. Follow by example of how they're 
  currently set.
  
  Upon start up, the Arduino will try to connect to the MetaWatch
  (via a BlueSMiRF). Then it'll set the time (as defined in the
  variables below), and update the clock display. The reset is
  up to you. Want to use a light-sensor to control the watch's
  backlight? Or maybe a button press on the Arduino should control
  the watch's vibration motor. Have fun! For help using the
  SFE_MetaWatch library, check out the readme included with it.
